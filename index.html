    <h2>Biography:</h2>

    <h4>Where Were You Born?</h4>
        <p> I was put on this <em> god forsaken earth</em> (Specifically, in Ajax) on October 16th, 2000. This is where I started my long journey. </p>

    <h4>What Schools Did You Attend?</h4>
        <p>I've attended a couple of schools in my life. I started my <em>rigorous</em> schooling at Altona Forest Public school in Pickering. 
        <br>I then, at the age of 5, moved to Barrie where I contiuned my education at Allendale Heights as well as Hewitts Creek. 
        <br>After graduating elementary I went to Innisdale Secondary School where I came more out of my shell (because I had to)
        <br>I had joined many clubs and teams such as Rugby and Band.
        <br>After graduating Highschool I was <em>✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:*homeless✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:*</em> (got kicked out the beginning of grade 12 lol) So I had to take time away from persuing my post secondary to work!
        <br> I worked for 2 years and then decieded to do Biotechnology at Canadore College! that is were I got my first taste of programming. After first year I had come to the conclusion
        <br>that Biotech was fun, but not something I would want a career in. Although I did quite enjoy the programming course I had using <em>PYTHON</em>. 
        <br> <em>But thats when the PANDEMIC hit</em>
        <br> After seeing how courses were being taught for the pandemic, I decided that it was not the way I would like to learn. So for 3 years I just <em> worked.</em>
        <br> I then saw that school were starting to have in person lessons so I decided it't time to start my education back up.
        <br> So now I'm attending Georgian College for Computer Programming and Analysis!
         </p>
    
     <h4>What Goals/Ambitions Do You Have?</h4>
     <p>My goal is to graduate this program with the best grades I can get and start up my programming career! I also enjoy doing art so I would <em>ideally</em> like to try and intertwine my
        <br> digital art with my programming.
